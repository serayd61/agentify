## Frontend Design Skill

### Aesthetic Guidelines
When building frontend interfaces, AVOID generic "AI slop" aesthetics:
- ❌ Inter, Roboto, Arial fonts
- ❌ Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- ❌ Minimal animations
- ❌ Generic card layouts

### Instead, USE:
- ✅ **Typography**: Bold, distinctive fonts (e.g., Space Grotesk, Clash Display, Satoshi)
- ✅ **Colors**: Cohesive dark themes with sharp accents, CSS variables for consistency
- ✅ **Motion**: Meaningful animations with Framer Motion
  - Staggered reveals on page load
  - Hover states that surprise
  - Scroll-triggered animations
- ✅ **Backgrounds**: Atmospheric gradients, subtle patterns, depth

### Design Process
Before coding any frontend:
1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve?
2. **Audience**: Who uses this? (Swiss SME owners = professional, trustworthy)
3. **Aesthetic Direction**: Choose BOLD direction (dark/elegant for Agentify)
4. **Key Moments**: Identify 3 high-impact interaction points
